## About The Alabama Memory Project

Most studies of lynching focus on where and why a person was lynched. The Alabama Memory Project does this, but also asks who were they before they died – where did they live, where did they work, who did they love? 

 

Based at the University of Alabama and inspired by the work of Ida B. Wells, W. E. B. Du Bois, and the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, the Alabama Memory Project (AMP) is an ongoing attempt to recapture the lives of the lynching victims and attempted lynching victims in Alabama before the worst day of their lives. We consider attempted lynchings along with documented lynchings in an effort to capture the breadth of lynch violence and its impact on survivors and their communities. 

AMP launched in January 2017 with an initial dataset composed of documented lynching victims in Alabama between 1877 and 1945 as published by Equal Justice Initiative, the Tuskegee Institute, the CSDE Lynching Database, and Monroe Work Today. Since then, AMP has gathered preliminary data suggesting more than 800 previously undocumented victims between 1865 and 1986. 

AMP hosts a yearly research seminar in which undergraduates and graduate students collaborate with community leaders and historians to research victims’ lives. They dedicate their semester to working in local archives, libraries, museums, and published databases to understand the world of the victims and build a testimony to their lives. In many cases, students continue their research for years after completing the course. 

We update the initial dataset annually with lynchings and attempted lynchings newly uncovered by our project.
